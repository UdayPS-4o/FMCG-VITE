To fix the server-side route issue, you need to register the cash-payments and cash-receipts merge routes in app.js. 

Add these lines after the existing godownTransferMergeRoutes registration in server/app.js:

```javascript
// Register cash payments merge routes
const cashPaymentsMergeRoutes = require('./routes/merge/cash-payments');
app.use('/api/merge/cash-payments', cashPaymentsMergeRoutes);

// Register cash receipts merge routes
const cashReceiptsMergeRoutes = require('./routes/merge/cash-receipts');
app.use('/api/merge/cash-receipts', cashReceiptsMergeRoutes);
```

This will properly register the routes so they can be accessed at the expected endpoints.
